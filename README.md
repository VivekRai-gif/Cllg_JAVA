# 💻 Java Programming Assignments – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository contains a series of Java programs based on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts along with Exception Handling, File I/O, and Multithreading. These assignments are designed to solidify your understanding of real-world Java programming practices.

## 📂 Assignment Topics & Problem Statements

### ✅ Basic Object Creation & Class Concepts
1. WAP to declare 2 packages having the same class name and create object of class present in both packages.
2. WAP to access a class `Student` in 4 ways:
   - By using object  
   - By using reference variable  
   - By using constructor  
   - By using method (Real-time example)
3. WAP to create a `Student` class with name, roll no, marks of 3 subjects, and print the result.
4. WAP to reverse a given string.
5. WAP to demonstrate use of `this` keyword.
6. WAP for 3 different uses of `this` keyword.

### 🧬 Inheritance
7. WAP for single-level inheritance.
8. WAP for multiple inheritance (Note: Not supported directly by Java).
9. WAP for hierarchical inheritance.
10. WAP for hybrid inheritance.

### 🧭 Keywords and Polymorphism
11. WAP demonstrating the use of `super` keyword.
12. WAP demonstrating method overriding.
13. WAP demonstrating method overloading.
14. WAP for run-time polymorphism using method overriding.
15. WAP for constructor overloading.

### ⚙️ Static & Abstract Concepts
16. WAP to demonstrate static block, static variable, and static method.
17. WAP using abstract class `Bank`, with child classes `SBI` and `PNB`.
18. WAP to achieve multiple inheritance using `interface`.

### 📦 Packages
19. WAP to create a Java package.
20. WAP to create a sub-package.
21. WAP to import 2 different classes from 2 different packages and use their methods.

### 📐 Logical & Pattern Programs
22. WAP to print the largest among 3 numbers (without using logical operators).
23. Write any 10 pattern programs (e.g., right-angled triangle, diamond, alphabet pyramid, etc.).

### 🔁 Recursion & Math Programs
24. WAP to calculate factorial of a number using recursion.
25. WAP to print a given table (with and without recursion).
26. WAP to perform addition of two matrices.
27. WAP to find out the day of the week for a given numeric value (e.g., 1 = Monday, …, 7 = Sunday).

### 🧱 Abstraction
28. WAP to demonstrate usage of abstract class.

## ❗ Exception Handling
29. WAP to demonstrate use of `try-catch`.
30. WAP to demonstrate use of `try-finally`.
31. WAP to show multiple `try-catch` blocks.
32. WAP to show nested `try-catch` blocks.
33. WAP to demonstrate `throw` keyword.
34. WAP to demonstrate `throws` keyword.
35. WAP to implement a custom exception class.

## 📂 File Handling (I/O)
36. WAP to write data to a file and read it back to print.
37. WAP to read data from 2 files and merge it into a single file.
38. WAP to read data from one file and split/write into 2 separate files.
39. WAP to count the total number of characters in a file.

---

## 🧵 Multithreading
40. WAP to show multiple threads executing in parallel using at least 10 methods of `Thread` class.
41. WAP to achieve inter-process communication using `wait()` and `notify()`.
